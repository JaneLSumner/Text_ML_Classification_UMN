[1] "[1] \"Item 1A. Risk Factors Drilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect theCompany<U+0092>s business, financial condition or results of operations. The Company<U+0092>s drilling andoperating activities are subject to numerous risks, including the risk that the Company will not discover commercially productive reservoirs. Drilling for oil and natural gas can be unprofitable if dry wells are drilled and if productive wells donot produce sufficient revenues to return a profit. Decisions to develop properties depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses, production data and engineering studies, the results of which areoften inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. The estimated cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is uncertain before drilling commences. Overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular projectuneconomical. In addition, the Company<U+0092>s drilling and producing operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of various factors, including the following:  <U+0095>  delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements including permitting;  <U+0095>  unusual or unexpected geological formations and miscalculations;  <U+0095>  shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified personnel;  <U+0095>  shortages of or delays in obtaining water for hydraulic fracturing operations;  <U+0095>  equipment malfunctions, failures or accidents;  <U+0095>  lack of available gathering facilities or delays in construction of gathering facilities;  <U+0095>  lack of available capacity on interconnecting transmission pipelines;  <U+0095>  lack of adequate electrical infrastructure;  <U+0095>  unexpected operational events and drilling conditions;  <U+0095>  pipe or cement failures and casing collapses;  <U+0095>  pressures, fires, blowouts and explosions;  <U+0095>  lost or damaged drilling and service tools;  <U+0095>  loss of drilling fluid circulation;  <U+0095>  uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine, water or drilling fluids;  <U+0095>  natural disasters;  <U+0095>  environmental hazards, such as oil and natural gas leaks, pipeline ruptures and discharges of toxic gases or well fluids;  <U+0095>  adverse weather conditions such as extreme cold, fires caused by extreme heat or lack of rain, and severe storms or tornadoes;  33  <U+0095>  reductions in oil and natural gas prices;  <U+0095>  oil and natural gas property title problems; and  <U+0095>  market limitations for oil and natural gas. Any of these risks can cause substantial losses, including personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction ofproperty, natural resources and equipment, environmental contamination or loss of wells and regulatory fines or penalties. Oil and natural gas prices fluctuate due to a number of factors that are beyond the control of the Company, and a decline in oiland natural gas prices could significantly affect the Company<U+0092>s financial results and impede its growth. The Company<U+0092>s revenues, profitability and cash flow are highly dependent upon the prices realized from the sale of oil and natural gas. The markets for these commodities are very volatile. Oil andnatural gas prices can fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors that are beyond the Company<U+0092>s control. These factors include, among others:  <U+0095>  regional, domestic and foreign supply of, and demand for, oil and natural gas, as well as perceptions of supply of, and demand for, oil and naturalgas;  <U+0095>  the price and quantity of foreign imports;  <U+0095>  U.S. and worldwide political and economic conditions;  <U+0095>  weather conditions and seasonal trends;  <U+0095>  anticipated future prices of oil and natural gas, alternative fuels and other commodities;  <U+0095>  technological advances affecting energy consumption and energy supply;  <U+0095>  the proximity, capacity, cost and availability of pipeline infrastructure, treating, transportation and refining capacity;  <U+0095>  natural disasters and other acts of force majeure;  <U+0095>  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxation;  <U+0095>  energy conservation and environmental measures; and  <U+0095>  the price and availability of alternative fuels. For oil, from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2011, the highest monthly NYMEX settled price was $140.00per Bbl and the lowest was $41.68 per Bbl. For natural gas, from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2011, the highest monthly NYMEX settled price was $13.11 per MMBtu and the lowest was $2.84 per MMBtu. In addition, the market price ofoil and natural gas is generally higher in the winter months than during other months of the year due to increased demand for oil and natural gas for heating purposes during the winter season. Lower oil and natural gas prices may not only decrease the Company<U+0092>s revenues on a per share basis, but also mayultimately reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that the Company can produce economically and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on the Company<U+0092>s financial condition and results of operations. This also may result in theCompany having to make substantial downward adjustments to its estimated proved reserves. Future price declines mayresult in further reductions of the asset carrying values of the Company<U+0092>s oil and natural gas properties. The Company utilizes the full cost method of accounting for costs related to its oil and natural gas properties. Under this accounting method, all costs for both productive and nonproductive propertiesare  34 capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the unit-of-production method. However, the amount of these costs that can be carried ascapitalized assets is subject to a ceiling, which limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues of proved oil and natural gas reserves attributable to proved properties, discounted at 10%, plus the lower ofcost or market value of unevaluated properties. The full cost ceiling is evaluated at the end of each quarter using the most recent 12-month average prices for oil and natural gas, adjusted for the impact of derivatives accounted for as cash flowhedges. In the event any of the Company<U+0092>s derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges, the impact of these derivative contracts will be included in the determination of the Company<U+0092>s full cost ceiling. The Company had no full costceiling impairments during the year ended December 31, 2011 or 2010, while its ceiling limitations during 2009 resulted in non-cash impairment charges totaling $1,693.3 million. Future declines in oil and natural gas prices, without othermitigating circumstances, could result in additional losses of future net revenues, including losses attributable to quantities that cannot be economically produced at lower prices, which could cause the Company to record additional write-downs ofcapitalized costs of its oil and natural gas properties and non-cash charges against future earnings. The amount of such future write-downs and non-cash charges could be substantial. The Company has a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations and commitments, which may adversely affect theCompany<U+0092>s cash flow and its ability to operate its business. As of December 31, 2011, theCompany<U+0092>s total indebtedness was $2.8 billion, and it had preferred stock outstanding with an aggregate liquidation preference of $765.0 million. The Company<U+0092>s substantial level of indebtedness and the dividends payable on itspreferred stock outstanding increases the possibility that it may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay, when due, the principal of, interest on or other amounts due in respect of its indebtedness and/or the preferred stock dividends. TheCompany<U+0092>s indebtedness and outstanding preferred stock, combined with its lease and other financial obligations and contractual commitments, such as its obligations to drill development wells for multiple royalty trusts, could have otherimportant consequences to the Company. For example, it could:  <U+0095>  make the Company more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in governmentregulation;  <U+0095>  require the Company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its indebtedness, thereby reducing theavailability of the Company<U+0092>s cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;  <U+0095>  limit the Company<U+0092>s flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the industry in which it operates;  <U+0095>  place the Company at a disadvantage compared to its competitors that are less leveraged and, therefore, may be able to take advantage ofopportunities that the Company<U+0092>s indebtedness prevents it from pursuing; and  <U+0095>  limit the Company<U+0092>s ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements,execution of its business strategy or other purposes. Any of the above listed factors couldhave a material adverse effect on the Company<U+0092>s business, financial condition and results of operations. TheCompany<U+0092>s estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any significant inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could materially affect the quantities and present value of theCompany<U+0092>s reserves. The Company<U+0092>s current estimates of reserves could change, potentially in material amounts, in the future. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex and inherently imprecise, requiring interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions, including assumptions relating toproduction  35 rates and economic factors such as oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, the assumed effect of governmental regulation and availability of funds. Anysignificant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in this report. See <U+0093>Business<U+0097>The Company<U+0092>s Businesses and Primary Operations<U+0094>in Item 1 of this report for information about the Company<U+0092>s oil and natural gas reserves. Actualfuture production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves most likely will vary from the Company<U+0092>s estimates. Any significant variancecould materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in this report, which in turn could have a negative effect on the value of the Company<U+0092>s assets. In addition, from time to time in the future, the Company mayadjust estimates of proved reserves, potentially in material amounts, to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond the Company<U+0092>s control. The present value of future net cash flows from the Company<U+0092>s proved reserves will not necessarily be the same asthe current market value of its estimated oil and natural gas reserves. The Company bases theestimated discounted future net cash flows from its proved reserves on 12-month average prices and costs. Actual future net cash flows from its oil and natural gas properties also will be affected by factors such as:  <U+0095>  actual prices the Company receives for oil and natural gas;  <U+0095>  the accuracy of the Company<U+0092>s reserve estimates;  <U+0095>  the actual cost of development and production expenditures;  <U+0095>  the amount and timing of actual production;  <U+0095>  supply of and demand for oil and natural gas; and  <U+0095>  changes in governmental regulations or taxation. The timing of both the Company<U+0092>s production and its incurrence of expenses in connection with the development andproduction of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the Company uses a 10% discount factor when calculating discounted future netcash flows, which may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with the Company or the oil and natural gas industry in general. Unless the Company replaces its oil and natural gas reserves, its reserves and production will decline, which would adverselyaffect its business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company<U+0092>s future oil andnatural gas reserves and production, and therefore its cash flow and income, are highly dependent on its success in efficiently developing and exploiting the Company<U+0092>s current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additionalrecoverable reserves. The Company may not be able to develop, find or acquire additional reserves to replace its current and future production at acceptable costs. The Company will not know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present in sufficient quantities to be economically producible. The use of seismic data and other technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area does not enable us toknow conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or, if present, whether oil or natural gas will be present in sufficient quantities to be economically viable. Even if sufficient amounts of oil or natural gas exist, theCompany may damage the potentially productive hydrocarbon bearing formation or  36 experience mechanical difficulties while drilling or completing the well, resulting in a reduction in production from the well or abandonment of the well. During 2011, the Company completed atotal of 936 gross wells, of which 3 were identified as dry wells. If the Company drills additional wells that it identifies as dry wells in its current and future prospects, the Company<U+0092>s drilling success rate may decline and materiallyharm its business. In summary, the cost of drilling, completing and operating any well is often uncertain, and new wells may not be productive. Production of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids could be materially and adversely affected by natural disasters or severe or unseasonable weather. Production of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids could be materially and adversely affected by natural disasters orsevere weather. Repercussions of natural disasters or severe weather conditions may include:  <U+0095>  evacuation of personnel and curtailment of operations;  <U+0095>  damage to drilling rigs or other facilities, resulting in suspension of operations;  <U+0095>  inability to deliver materials to worksites; and  <U+0095>  damage to pipelines and other transportation facilities. In addition, the Company<U+0092>s hydraulic fracturing operations require significant quantities of water. Certain regionsin which the Company operates, including Texas, recently have experienced drought conditions. Any diminished access to water for use in hydraulic fracturing, whether due to usage restrictions or drought or other weather conditions, could curtail theCompany<U+0092>s operations or otherwise result in delays in operations or increased costs. Volatility in the capitalmarkets could affect the Company<U+0092>s ability to obtain capital, cause the Company to incur additional financing expense or affect the value of certain assets. In recent periods, global financial markets and economic conditions have been volatile due to multiple factors, includingsignificant write-offs in the financial services sector and weak economic conditions. In some cases, the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit capacity for certain issuers without regard to those issuers<U+0092> underlyingfinancial and/or operating strength. Due to this volatility, for many companies the cost of raising money in the debt and equity capital markets has been greater in recent periods than has historically been the case. Continued market volatility mayfrom time to time adversely affect the Company<U+0092>s ability to access capital and credit markets or to obtain funds at low interest rates or on other advantageous terms. These factors may adversely affect the Company<U+0092>s business, results ofoperations or liquidity. These factors may adversely affect the value of certain of the Company<U+0092>s assetsand its ability to draw on its senior credit facility. Adverse credit and capital market conditions may require the Company to reduce the carrying value of assets associated with derivative contracts to account for non-performance by, or increasedcredit risk from counterparties to those contracts. If financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to the Company are adversely affected by volatile conditions of the United States and international capital markets, they may becomeunable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments to the Company, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company<U+0092>s financial condition and its ability to borrow additional funds, if needed, for working capital, capitalexpenditures and other corporate purposes. Properties that the Company buys may not produce as projected, and theCompany may be unable to determine reserve potential, identify liabilities associated with the properties or obtain protection from sellers against them. The Company<U+0092>s initial technical reviews of properties it acquires are inherently incomplete because an in-depthreview of every individual property involved in each acquisition generally is not feasible. Even a  37 detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fullytheir deficiencies and potential. Inspections may not always be performed on every well and environmental problems, such as soil or ground water contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problemsare identified, the Company may assume certain environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties, and such risks and liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the Company<U+0092>s results of operations andfinancial condition. The development of the Company<U+0092>s proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may requirehigher levels of capital expenditures than it currently anticipates. As of December 31, 2011, 51%of the Company<U+0092>s total reserves were proved undeveloped reserves. Development of these reserves may take longer and require higher levels of capital expenditures than the Company currently anticipates. Therefore, ultimate recoveries from thesefields may not match current expectations. Delays in the development of the Company<U+0092>s reserves or increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves will reduce the PV-10 value of its estimated proved undeveloped reserves and future netrevenues estimated for such reserves. A significant portion of the Company<U+0092>s operations are located in northwestOklahoma, Kansas and west Texas, making it vulnerable to risks associated with operating in a limited number of major geographic areas. As of December 31, 2011, approximately 71% of the Company<U+0092>s proved reserves and approximately 66% of its annual production were located in the Mid-Continent and Permian Basin. This concentrationcould disproportionately expose the Company to operational and regulatory risk in these areas. This relative lack of diversification in location of the Company<U+0092>s key operations could expose it to adverse developments in these areas or the oiland natural gas markets, including, for example, transportation or treatment capacity constraints, curtailment of production or treatment plant closures for scheduled maintenance. These factors could have a significantly greater impact on theCompany<U+0092>s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows than if its properties were more diversified. The Company<U+0092>s development and exploration operations require substantial capital, and the Company may be unable to obtainneeded capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in the Company<U+0092>s oil and natural gas reserves. The oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive. The Company makes substantial capital expenditures in its businessand operations for the exploration, development, production and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves. Historically, the Company has financed capital expenditures primarily with proceeds from asset sales and from the sale of equity, debt andcash generated by operations. The Company expects to finance its future capital expenditures with the sale of equity and debt securities, cash flow from operations, asset sales and current and new financing arrangements. The Company<U+0092>s cash flowfrom operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including:  <U+0095>  the Company<U+0092>s proved reserves;  <U+0095>  the level of oil and natural gas it is able to produce from existing wells;  <U+0095>  the prices at which oil and natural gas are sold; and  <U+0095>  the Company<U+0092>s ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves. If the Company<U+0092>s revenues decrease as a result of lower oil and natural gas prices, operating difficulties, declinesin reserves or for any other reason, it may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain its operations at current levels. In order to fund the Company<U+0092>s capital expenditures, it may seek additional  38 financing. However, the Company<U+0092>s senior credit facility contains covenants limiting its ability to incur additional indebtedness, which its lenders may withhold in their sole discretion.The Company<U+0092>s senior note indentures also contain covenants that may restrict its ability to incur additional indebtedness if it does not satisfy certain financial metrics. If the Company is unable to obtain additional financing, it may benecessary for it to reduce or suspend its capital expenditures. Disruptions in the global financial andcapital markets also could adversely affect the Company<U+0092>s ability to obtain debt or equity financing on favorable terms, or at all. The failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of the Company<U+0092>s operationsrelating to exploration and development of its prospects, which in turn could lead to a possible loss of properties and a decline in the Company<U+0092>s oil and natural gas reserves. The agreements governing the Company<U+0092>s existing indebtedness have restrictions, financial covenants and borrowing baseredeterminations which could adversely affect its operations. The Company<U+0092>s senior creditfacility and the indentures governing its senior notes restrict its ability to obtain additional financing, make investments, lease equipment, sell assets and engage in business combinations. The Company also is required to comply with certainfinancial covenants and ratios. The Company<U+0092>s ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants in the future is uncertain and could be affected by the levels of cash flow from its operations and events or circumstances beyond itscontrol. If commodity prices decline, this could adversely affect the Company<U+0092>s ability to meet such restrictions and covenants. The Company<U+0092>s failure to comply with any of the restrictions and covenants under the senior credit facility,senior notes or other debt financing could result in a default under those instruments, which could cause all of its existing indebtedness to be immediately due and payable. The Company<U+0092>s senior credit facility limits the amounts it can borrow to a borrowing base amount. The borrowing baseis subject to review semi-annually; however, the lenders reserve the right to have one additional re-determination of the borrowing base per calendar year. Unscheduled re-determinations may be made at the Company<U+0092>s request, but is limited totwo requests per year. Borrowing base determinations are based upon proved developed producing reserves, proved developed non-producing reserves and proved undeveloped reserves. Outstanding borrowings exceeding the borrowing base must be repaidpromptly, or it must pledge other oil and natural gas properties as additional collateral. The Company may not have the financial resources in the future to make any mandatory principal prepayments under the senior credit facility, which isrequired, for example, when the committed line of credit is exceeded, proceeds of asset sales in new oil and natural gas properties are not reinvested, or indebtedness that is not permitted by the terms of the senior credit facility is incurred. Ifthe indebtedness under the Company<U+0092>s senior credit facility and senior notes were to be accelerated, its assets may not be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full. The Company<U+0092>s derivative activities could result in financial losses and could reduce its earnings. To achieve a more predictable cash flow and to reduce the Company<U+0092>s exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices ofoil and natural gas, the Company currently has, and may in the future, enter into derivative contracts for a portion of its oil and natural gas production, including fixed price swaps, collars and basis swaps. The Company has not and does not planto designate any of its derivative contracts as hedges for accounting purposes and, as a result, records all derivative contracts on its balance sheet at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized in current period earnings. Accordingly,the Company<U+0092>s earnings may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in fair value of its derivative contracts. Derivative contracts also expose the Company to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when:  <U+0095>  production is less than expected;  <U+0095>  the counterparty to the derivative contract defaults on its contract obligations; or  <U+0095>  there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the derivative contract and actual prices received.  39 In addition, these types of derivative contracts limit the benefit theCompany would receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas. All of the Company<U+0092>s consolidateddrilling and services revenues are derived from companies in the oil and natural gas industry. Companies to which the Company provides drilling and related services are affected by the oil and natural gas industryrisks mentioned above. Market prices of oil and natural gas, limited access to capital and reductions in capital expenditures could result in oil and natural gas companies canceling or curtailing their drilling programs, which could reduce thedemand for the Company<U+0092>s drilling and related services. Any prolonged reduction in the overall level of exploration and development activities, whether resulting from changes in oil and natural gas prices or otherwise, could impact theCompany<U+0092>s drilling and services segment by negatively affecting:  <U+0095>  revenues, cash flow and profitability;  <U+0095>  the Company<U+0092>s ability to retain skilled rig personnel whom it would need in the event of an upturn in the demand for drilling and relatedservices; and  <U+0095>  the fair value of the Company<U+0092>s rig fleet. A significant or prolonged decrease in natural gas production in the Company<U+0092>s areas of operations, due to declines in production from existing wells, depressed commodity prices or otherwise,would adversely affect its ability to satisfy certain contractual obligations and revenues and cash flow from the Company<U+0092>s midstream gas services segment. In June 2009, the Company sold an entity, Piñon Gathering Company, LLC (<U+0093>PGC<U+0094>), holding its gathering andcompression assets located in the Piñon Field, which is part of the WTO in Pecos County, Texas, to an unaffiliated third party. In conjunction with the sale, the Company entered into a gas gathering agreement pursuant to which it dedicatedits Piñon Field acreage to PGC for gathering services for 20 years. During that period, the Company has minimum throughput and delivery obligations to PGC. In addition, the Company continues to construct gathering and compression assets inthe Piñon Field. Most of the reserves supporting the Company<U+0092>s contractual obligations to PGC and its own midstream assets are operated by the Company<U+0092>s exploration and production segment. A material decrease in natural gasproduction in the Company<U+0092>s areas of operation would result in a decline in the volume of natural gas delivered to PGC and the Company<U+0092>s pipelines and facilities for gathering, transporting and treating. The Company has no control overmany factors affecting production activity, including prevailing and projected energy prices, demand for hydrocarbons, the level of reserves, geological considerations, governmental regulation and the availability and cost of capital. The Company isobligated to pay minimum fees under the gas gathering agreement with PGC if it does not satisfy the contractual throughput and delivery commitments to PGC, due, for example, to the Company<U+0092>s failure to connect new wells to PGC<U+0092>s gatheringsystems or when there is a decline in the amount of natural gas that the Company produces from the Piñon Field. See Note 16 in Item 8 of this report for contractual amounts due under this agreement. In addition, if the Company fails toconnect new wells to its own gathering systems, the amount of natural gas it gathers, transports and treats will decline substantially over time and could, upon exhaustion of the current wells, cause the Company to abandon its gathering systems and,possibly cease gathering, transporting and treating operations. Many of the Company<U+0092>sprospects in the WTO may contain natural gas that is high in CO2content, which can negatively affect the Company<U+0092>s economics. 2 content, which can negatively affect the Company<U+0092>s economics. Thereservoirs of many of the Company<U+0092>s prospects in the WTO may contain natural gas that is high in CO 2 content. The natural gas produced from these reservoirs must be treated for the removal of CO 2 prior to marketing. If the Company cannot obtain sufficient capacity at treatment facilities for its natural gas with ahigh  40 CO 2 concentration, or if the cost to obtain such capacity significantly increases, the Company could be forced to delay production and development or experience increased production costs. The Company will not know the amount of CO 2 that it will encounter in any well until it is drilled. As a result,sometimes the Company encounters CO 2 levels in its wells thatare higher than expected. Since the treatment expenses are incurred on a Mcf basis, the Company will incur a higher effective treating cost per MMBtu of natural gas sold for natural gas with a higher CO 2 content. As a result, high CO 2 gas wells must produce at much higher rates than low CO 2 gas wells to be economic, especially in a low natural gas priceenvironment. Furthermore, when the Company treats the gas for the removal of CO 2 , some of the methane is used to run the treatment plant as fuel gas andother methane and heavier hydrocarbons, such as ethane, propane and butane, cannot be separated from the CO 2 and is lost. This is known as plant shrink. Historically the Company<U+0092>s plant shrink has been approximately 6% in the WTO. After giving effect to plant shrink, as many as 3.5 Mcf of highCO 2 natural gas must be produced to sell one MMBtu of naturalgas. The Company reports its volumes of natural gas reserves and production net of CO 2 volumes that are removed prior to sales. The Company<U+0092>s use of 2-Dand 3-D seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of oil and natural gas. In addition, the use of such technology requires greater predrilling expenditures, which could adversely affect the results of theCompany<U+0092>s drilling operations. A significant aspect of the Company<U+0092>s exploration anddevelopment plan involves seismic data. Even when properly used and interpreted, 2-D and 3-D seismic data and visualization techniques are only tools used to assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators and donot enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are present in those structures. Other geologists and petroleum professionals, when studying the same seismic data, may have significantly different interpretations than the Company<U+0092>sprofessionals. In addition, the use of 2-D and 3-D seismic and other advanced technologies requires greaterpredrilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies, and the Company could incur losses due to such expenditures. As a result, the Company<U+0092>s drilling activities may not be geologically successful or economical, and the Company<U+0092>soverall drilling success rate or its drilling success rate for activities in a particular area may not improve. The Company may often gather 2-D and 3-D seismic data over large areas. The Company<U+0092>s interpretation of seismic datadelineates for it those portions of an area that it believes are desirable for drilling. Therefore, the Company may choose not to acquire option or lease rights prior to acquiring seismic data, and in many cases, it may identify hydrocarbonindicators before seeking option or lease rights in the location. If the Company is not able to lease those locations on acceptable terms, it will have made substantial expenditures to acquire and analyze 2-D and 3-D seismic data without having anopportunity to attempt to benefit from those expenditures. Oil and natural gas wells are subject to operational hazardsthat can cause substantial losses for which the Company may not be adequately insured. There are avariety of operating risks inherent in oil and natural gas production and associated activities, such as fires, leaks, explosions, mechanical problems, major equipment failures, blowouts, uncontrollable flow of oil, natural gas and natural gasliquids, water or drilling fluids, casing collapses, abnormally pressurized formations and natural disasters. The occurrence of any of these or similar accidents that temporarily or permanently halt the production and sale of oil and natural gas atany of the Company<U+0092>s properties could have a material adverse impact on its business activities, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, if any of such risks or similar accidents occur, the Company could incur substantial losses as a result of injury or loss of life, severe damage or destruction of property, natural resourcesand equipment, regulatory investigation and penalties and environmental damage and clean-up responsibility. If the Company  41 experiences any of these problems, its ability to conduct operations could be adversely affected. While the Company maintains insurance coverage it deems appropriate for these risks, theCompany<U+0092>s operations may result in liabilities exceeding such insurance coverage or liabilities not covered by insurance. Shortages or increases in costs of equipment, services and qualified personnel could adversely affect the Company<U+0092>s ability toexecute its exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within its budget. The demand forqualified and experienced personnel to conduct field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with oil and natural gas prices,causing periodic shortages. Historically, there have been shortages of drilling rigs and other equipment as demand for rigs and equipment has increased along with the number of wells being drilled. These factors also cause significant increases incosts for equipment, services and personnel. Higher oil and natural gas prices generally stimulate demand and result in increased prices for drilling rigs, crews and associated supplies, equipment and services. Shortages of field personnel andequipment or price increases could significantly affect the Company<U+0092>s ability to execute its exploration and development plans as projected. Market conditions or operational impediments may hinder the Company<U+0092>s access to oil and natural gas markets or delay its production. Market conditions or a lack of satisfactory oil and natural gas transportation arrangements may hinderthe Company<U+0092>s access to oil and natural gas markets or delay its production. The availability of a ready market for the Company<U+0092>s oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of oil andnatural gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities. The Company<U+0092>s ability to market its production depends, in substantial part, on the availability and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines and treatingfacilities. For example, in 2009 the Company experienced capacity limitations on high CO 2 gas treating in the Piñon Field. The Company<U+0092>s failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms in the future or expand the Company<U+0092>s midstream assets could have a material adverseeffect on its business. The Company may be required to shut in wells for a lack of a market or because access to natural gas pipelines, gathering system capacity or treating facilities may be limited or unavailable. The Company would be unable torealize revenue from any shut-in wells until production arrangements were made to deliver the production to market. Competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, which may adversely affect the Company<U+0092>s ability to succeed. The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive, and the Company competes with companiesthat have greater resources than it does. Many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas, but also conduct refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. Thesecompanies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or identify, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than the Company<U+0092>s financial or human resourcespermit. In addition, these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas market prices. The Company<U+0092>s larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of present and futurefederal, state, local and other laws and regulations more easily than the Company can, which would adversely affect the Company<U+0092>s competitive position. The Company<U+0092>s ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in thefuture will be dependent upon its ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. In addition, because the Company has fewer financial and human resources than many companies inits industry, the Company may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas properties. See <U+0093>Business<U+0097>Competition<U+0094> in Item 1 of this report. Downturns in oil and natural gas prices can result in decreased oil field activity, which, in turn, can result in anoversupply of service providers and drilling rigs. This oversupply can result in severe reductions in prices received for oil field services or a complete lack of work for crews and equipment.  42 The cost to construct the Century Plant may exceed estimatedcosts, and the Company may not be able to satisfy its CO2 volumedelivery requirements. 2 volumedelivery requirements. The Company is constructing the Century Plant, aCO 2 treatment plant in Pecos County, Texas, and associatedcompression and pipeline facilities pursuant to an agreement with a subsidiary of Occidental. The Century Plant will be owned and operated by Occidental for the purpose of separating and removing CO 2 from natural gas delivered by the Company. The cost to construct theCentury Plant may exceed current estimated costs, which exceeded the contract amount by approximately $130.0 million as of December 31, 2011. Pursuant to a 30-year treating agreement executed simultaneously with the construction agreement,Occidental will remove CO 2 from the Company<U+0092>s deliveredproduction volumes, with the Company required to deliver certain minimum volumes annually and compensate Occidental to the extent such requirements are not met. The Company may not be able to find, produce and deliver enough high CO 2 gas to meet its delivery obligations. As of December 31, 2011, theCompany expects to accrue between approximately $17.0 million and $21.0 million during the year ending December 31, 2012 for amounts related to the Company<U+0092>s shortfall in meeting its natural gas delivery obligations. In addition, there aresignificant risks associated with the operation and performance of a facility such as the Century Plant with no guarantee that the Century Plant will operate at its designed capacity or otherwise perform as anticipated. The Company is subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manneror feasibility of conducting its operations or expose it to significant liabilities. TheCompany<U+0092>s oil and natural gas exploration, production, transportation and treatment operations are subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations. In order to conduct its operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, theCompany must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental authorities. The Company may incur substantial costs in order to maintain compliance with these existing laws andregulations. Further, in light of the explosion and fire on the drilling rig Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as recent incidents involving the release of oil and natural gas and fluids as a result of drilling activities in theUnited States, there has been a variety of regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels to restrict oil and natural gas drilling operations in certain locations. Any increased regulation or suspension of oil and natural gas exploration andproduction, or revision or reinterpretation of existing laws and regulations, that arises out of these incidents or otherwise could result in delays and higher operating costs. Such costs or significant delays could have a material adverse effect onthe Company<U+0092>s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company must also comply with laws and regulations prohibiting fraud and market manipulations in energy markets. To the extent the Company is a shipper on interstatepipelines, it must comply with the tariffs of such pipelines and with federal policies related to the use of interstate capacity. Laws and regulations governing oil and natural gas exploration and production may also affect production levels. The Company is required to comply with federal and state laws and regulations governingconservation matters, including provisions related to the unitization or pooling of the oil and natural gas properties; the establishment of maximum rates of production from wells; the spacing of wells; and the plugging and abandonment of wells.These and other laws and regulations can limit the amount of oil and natural gas the Company can produce from its wells, limit the number of wells it can drill, or limit the locations at which it can conduct drilling operations. New laws or regulations, or changes to existing laws or regulations may unfavorably impact the Company, could result inincreased operating costs and have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations. For example, Congress has recently considered, and may continue to consider, legislation that, if adopted in its proposed form, wouldsubject companies involved in oil and natural gas exploration and production activities to, among other items, additional regulation of and restrictions on hydraulic fracturing of wells, and the elimination of most U.S. federal tax incentivesand deductions available to oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the <U+0093>Dodd-Frank Act<U+0094>) and rules promulgated thereunder could reduce tradingpositions in the energy  43 futures or swaps markets and materially reduce hedging opportunities for the Company, which could adversely affect its revenues and cash flows during periods of low commodity prices, and whichcould adversely affect the ability to restructure the Company<U+0092>s hedges when it might be desirable to do so. Additionally, state and federal regulatory authorities may expand or alter applicable pipeline safety laws and regulations, compliance with which may require increased capital costs on the part of theCompany and third-party downstream oil and natural gas transporters. These and other potential regulations could increase the Company<U+0092>s operating costs, reduce its liquidity, delay its operations, increase direct and third-party post productioncosts or otherwise alter the way it conducts its business, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company<U+0092>s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and which could reduce cash received by or available fordistribution, including any amounts paid by the Company for transportation on downstream interstate pipelines. TheCompany<U+0092>s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting operations or result in significant costs and liabilities. The Company<U+0092>s oil and natural gas exploration and production operations are subject to stringent and comprehensivefederal, state, tribal, regional and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations that areapplicable to the Company<U+0092>s operations, including the acquisition of a permit before conducting drilling; water withdrawal or waste disposal activities; the restriction of types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be releasedinto the environment; the limitation or prohibition of drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; impose regulations designed to protect employees from exposure to hazardous substances; and theimposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations. Numerous governmental authorities, such as the EPA and analogous state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permitsissued under them, often requiring difficult and costly actions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in litigation; the assessment of administrative, civil or criminal penalties; the imposition of investigatory or remedialobligations; and the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of the Company<U+0092>s operations. There is inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in the performance of the Company<U+0092>s operations due to its handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes, because ofair emissions and wastewater discharges related to its operations, and as a result of historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. Under certain environmental laws and regulations, the Company could be subject to joint and severalstrict liability for the investigation, removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination regardless of whether it was responsible for the release or contamination and whether its operations were in compliance withall applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. Private parties, including the owners of properties upon which the Company<U+0092>s wells are drilled and facilities where the Company<U+0092>s petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes are taken forreclamation or disposal may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance, as well as to seek damages for contamination even in the absence of non-compliance, with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury,natural resources damage or property damage. In addition, the risk of accidental spills or releases could expose the Company to significant liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on the Company<U+0092>s financial condition or results ofoperations. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent or costly construction, drilling, water management, completion, waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanuprequirements could require the Company to incur significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. The Company maynot be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance. As a result of the increased cost of compliance, the Company may decide to discontinue drilling.  44 Repercussions from terrorist activities or armed conflict could harm theCompany<U+0092>s business. Terrorist activities, anti-terrorist efforts or other armed conflictinvolving the United States or its interests abroad may adversely affect the United States and global economies and could prevent the Company from meeting its financial and other obligations. If events of this nature occur and persist, the attendantpolitical instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil and natural gas, potentially putting downward pressure on prevailing oil and natural gas prices and causing a reduction in the Company<U+0092>s revenues. Oil and naturalgas production facilities, transportation systems and storage facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks, and or operations could be adversely impacted if infrastructure integral to the Company<U+0092>s operations is destroyed by such anattack. Costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats, and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain, if available at all. If the Company fails to maintain an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting, it could adversely affect the Company<U+0092>s ability to accurately report its results. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financialreporting. The Company<U+0092>s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generallyaccepted accounting principles. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in its internal control over financial reporting that results in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interimfinancial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Effective internal controls are necessary for the Company to provide reliable financial reports and deter and detect any material fraud. If the Company cannot provide reliablefinancial reports or prevent material fraud, its reputation and operating results would be harmed. The Company<U+0092>s efforts to develop and maintain its internal controls may not be successful, and it may be unable to maintain adequate controlsover its financial processes and reporting in the future, including future compliance with the obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or difficulties encounteredin their implementation, including those related to acquired businesses, or other effective improvement of the Company<U+0092>s internal controls could harm its operating results. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to loseconfidence in the Company<U+0092>s reported financial information. Certain U.S. federal income tax preferences currentlyavailable with respect to oil and natural gas production may be eliminated as a result of future legislation. In recent years, the Obama administration<U+0092>s budget proposals and other proposed legislation have included the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available tooil and gas exploration and production. If enacted into law, these proposals would eliminate certain tax preferences applicable to taxpayers engaged in the exploration or production of natural resources. These changes include, but are not limited to(i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (iii) the elimination of the deduction for U.S. productionactivities and (iv) the increase in the amortization period from two years to seven years for geophysical costs paid or incurred in connection with the exploration for or development of, oil and gas within the United States. It is unclearwhether any such changes will be enacted or how soon any such changes would become effective. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could negatively affect theCompany<U+0092>s financial condition and results of operations. New derivatives legislation and regulation couldadversely affect the Company<U+0092>s ability to hedge risks associated with its business. TheDodd-Frank Act creates a new regulatory framework for oversight of derivatives transactions by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the <U+0093>CFTC<U+0094>) and the SEC. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act subjects certain swap participants tonew capital, margin and business conduct standards. In addition, the Dodd-  45 Frank Act contemplates that where appropriate in light of outstanding exposures, trading liquidity and other factors, swaps (broadly defined to include most hedging instruments other thanfutures) will be required to be cleared through a registered clearing facility and traded on a designated exchange or swap execution facility. The Dodd-Frank Act also establishes a new Energy and Environmental Markets Advisory Committee to makerecommendations to the CFTC regarding matters of concern to exchanges, firms, end users and regulators with respect to energy and environmental markets and also expands the CFTC<U+0092>s power to impose position limits on specific categories of swaps(excluding swaps entered into for bona fide hedging purposes). There are some exceptions to theserequirements for entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk. While the Company may qualify for one or more of such exceptions, the scope of these exceptions is uncertain and will be further defined through rulemaking proceedings atthe CFTC and SEC. Further, although the Company may qualify for exceptions, its derivatives counterparties may be subject to new capital, margin and business conduct requirements imposed as a result of the new legislation, which may increase theCompany<U+0092>s transaction costs or make it more difficult for it to enter into hedging transactions on favorable terms. The Company<U+0092>s inability to enter into hedging transactions on favorable terms, or at all, could increase its operatingexpenses and put it at increased exposure to risks of adverse changes in oil and natural gas prices, which could adversely affect the predictability of cash flows from sales of oil and natural gas. In November 2011, the CFTC finalized rules to establish a position limits regime on certain <U+0093>core<U+0094>physical-delivery contracts and their economically equivalent derivatives, some of which reference major energy commodities, including oil and natural gas. The final rules became effective on January 17, 2012 and compliance with the rules shallbe required 60 days after the CFTC completes certain definitional rulemaking, which is expected to occur later in 2012. Therefore, it is not possible at this time to predict the consequences that will arise from the new position limits regime.Regulations that subject the Company or its derivatives counterparties to limits on commodity positions could have an adverse effect on the Company<U+0092>s ability to hedge risks associated with its business or on the cost of its hedging activity. Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives as well as governmental reviews relating to hydraulicfracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays as well as adversely affect the Company<U+0092>s level of production. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tightformations, such as shales. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The process is typically regulated by state oil and gascommissions. However, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing practices. Also, legislation has been introduced, but not enacted, in Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and torequire disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. Certain states in which the Company operates, including Texas and Oklahoma, and municipalities have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations that have imposed, or thatcould impose, more stringent permitting, disclosure, disposal and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. For example, in December 2011, the Railroad Commission of Texas finalized regulations requiring public disclosure ofall the chemicals in fluids used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Local ordinances or other regulations may regulate or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general and hydraulic fracturing in particular. If new laws or regulations thatsignificantly restrict or regulate hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such legal requirements could cause project delays and make it more difficult or costly for the Company to perform fracturing to stimulate production from a formation. These delaysor additional costs could adversely affect the determination of whether a well is commercially viable. Restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that the Company is ultimately able to produce incommercial quantities. In addition, a number of federal agencies are analyzing, or have been requested toreview, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. The White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration-wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices, and a committee of the United  46 States House of Representatives has conducted an investigation of hydraulic fracturing practices. The EPA has commenced a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing ondrinking water and groundwater, with initial results expected to be available by late 2012 and final results by 2014. Moreover, the EPA announced on October 20, 2011 that it is also launching a study regarding wastewater resulting fromhydraulic fracturing activities and currently plans to propose standards by 2014 that such wastewater must meet before being transported to a treatment plant. In addition, the U.S. Department of Energy is conducting an investigation of practices theagency could recommend to better protect the environment from drilling using hydraulic fracturing completion methods. Also, the U.S. Department of the Interior is considering disclosure requirements or other mandates for hydraulic fracturing onfederal lands. Additionally, certain members of Congress have called upon the U.S. Government Accountability Office to investigate how hydraulic fracturing might adversely affect water resources; the SEC to investigate the natural gas industry andany possible misleading of investors or the public regarding the economic feasibility of pursuing natural gas deposits in shales by means of hydraulic fracturing; and the U.S. Energy Information Administration to provide a better understanding ofthat agency<U+0092>s estimates regarding natural gas reserves, including reserves from shale formations, as well as uncertainties associated with those estimates. These ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and anymeaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act or other regulatory mechanisms. Climate change laws and regulations restricting emissions of <U+0093>greenhouse gases<U+0094> could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas that the Companyproduces while the physical effects of climate change could disrupt its production and cause the Company to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects. In December 2009, the EPA published its findings that emissions of GHGs present a danger to public health and theenvironment. These findings allow the agency to adopt and implement regulations that would restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act. Accordingly, the EPA has adopted rules that require a reduction in emissions ofGHGs from motor vehicles and also trigger Clean Air Act construction and operating permit review for GHG emissions from certain stationary sources. The EPA<U+0092>s rules relating to emissions of GHGs from stationary sources of emissions are currentlysubject to a number of political and legal challenges, but the federal courts have thus far declined to issue any injunctions to prevent the EPA from implementing, or requiring state environmental agencies to implement, the rules. In addition, theEPA has adopted rules requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from onshore oil and natural gas production facilities in the United States on an annual basis. Both houses of Congress have from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissionsof GHGs and almost one-half of the states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, already have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs. The adoption and implementation of any regulations imposingreporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, the Company<U+0092>s equipment and operations could require it to incur additional costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with its operations or could adversely affect demand for theoil and natural gas that it produces. Finally, some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth<U+0092>s atmosphere may produce climate changes that could have significant physical effects, such as increased frequencyand severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on the Company<U+0092>s assets and operations. Risks Related to the Company<U+0092>s Acquisition of Dynamic Offshore Resources, LLC If the Company completes its pending acquisition of Dynamic, its business and prospects will be subject to additional risks relating to Dynamic<U+0092>s offshore operations in the Gulf of Mexico, and risksrelating to offshore operations generally may become more significant to the operation of the Company<U+0092>s business as a whole. The Company may not realize the anticipated benefits of its pending acquisition of Dynamic or other future acquisitions, and integration of acquisitions may disrupt the Company<U+0092>s business andmanagement.  47 The Company<U+0092>s acquisition of Dynamic is pending and the Company mayacquire other companies or large asset packages in the future, as it has done in the past. The Company may not realize the anticipated benefits of the Dynamic acquisition or other future acquisitions, and each acquisition has numerous risks. Theserisks include:  <U+0095>  difficulty in assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired company;  <U+0095>  difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies during the transition and integration;  <U+0095>  disruption of the Company<U+0092>s ongoing business and distraction of its management and employees from other opportunities and challenges;  <U+0095>  difficulty integrating the acquired company<U+0092>s accounting, management information systems, human resources and other administrative systems;  <U+0095>  inability to retain key personnel of the acquired business;  <U+0095>  inability to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses;  <U+0095>  inability to take advantage of anticipated tax benefits;  <U+0095>  potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquiredbusiness;  <U+0095>  exposure to litigation and other potential liabilities in connection with environmental laws regulating exploration and production activitiesrelated to entities that the Company acquires, or that were previously acquired by such entities;  <U+0095>  exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of, an acquisition, including butnot limited to, claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third-parties;  <U+0095>  potential inability to assert that internal controls over financial reporting are effective; and  <U+0095>  potential incompatibility of business cultures. If the Company completes the Dynamic acquisition, Dynamic<U+0092>s offshore operations will involve special risks that could adversely affect operations. Offshore operations are subject to a variety of operating risks specific to the marine environment, such as capsizing,collisions and damage or loss from hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions. These conditions can cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production. As a result, if the Company completes the Dynamic acquisition, it could incursubstantial liabilities that could reduce or eliminate the funds available for exploration, development or leasehold acquisitions or result in loss of equipment and properties. In addition, if the Company completes the Dynamic acquisition, an oil spill on or related to offshore properties andoperations could expose the Company to joint and several strict liability, without regard to fault, under applicable law for all containment and oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages including, but not limited to, the costsof responding to a release of oil, natural resource damages, and economic damages suffered by persons adversely affected by an oil spill. If an oil discharge or substantial threat of discharge were to occur, the Company may be liable for costs anddamages, which costs and damages could be material to its business, financial condition or results of operations. Ifthe Company completes the Dynamic acquisition, reserves associated with Gulf of Mexico properties would have relatively short production periods or reserve lives. High production rates generally result in recovery of a relatively higher percentage of reserves from properties in theGulf of Mexico during the initial few years when compared to other regions in the United States.  48 Due to high initial production rates, production of reserves from reservoirs in the Gulf of Mexico generally decline more rapidly than from other producing reservoirs. As a result, if the Companycompletes the Dynamic acquisition, its reserve replacement needs from new prospects in the Gulf of Mexico may be greater than reserve replacement needs for other properties with longer-life reserves in other producing areas. Also, expected revenuesand return on capital for Gulf of Mexico properties will depend on prices prevailing during these relatively short production periods. If the Company completes the Dynamic acquisition, its operations in the Gulf of Mexico may face broad adverse consequences resulting from increased regulation of offshore drilling operations as aresult of the Deepwater Horizon incident, some of which may be unforeseeable. The April 2010 explosionand fire on the drilling rig Deepwater Horizon and resulting major oil spill produced significant economic, environmental and natural resource damage in the Gulf Coast region. In response to the explosion and spill, there have been many proposals bygovernmental and private constituencies to address the direct impact of the disaster and to prevent similar disasters in the future. The BOEMRE issued a series of <U+0093>Notices to Lessees and Operators<U+0094> (<U+0093>NTLs<U+0094>), which imposed avariety of new safety measures and permitting requirements, and implemented a temporary moratorium on deepwater drilling activities in the Gulf of Mexico that effectively shut down deepwater drilling activities for six months in 2010. Despite thefact that the drilling moratorium was lifted, this spill and its aftermath have led to delays in obtaining drilling permits from the BOEMRE. If the Company completes the Dynamic acquisition, it will be required to interact with both BOEM and BSEE toobtain approval of exploration and development plans and issuance of drilling permits for Dynamic<U+0092>s properties, which may result in added plan approval or drilling permit delays. While legislation has been introduced in the U.S. Congress toexpedite the process for obtaining offshore permits that include limitations on the timeframe for environmental and judicial review, there is no guarantee that this or similar legislation will pass. In addition to the drilling restrictions, new safety measures and permitting requirements issued by the BOEMRE, therehave been numerous additional proposed changes in laws, regulations, guidance and policy in response to the Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill that could affect offshore operations and cause the Company to incur substantial losses orexpenditures if it completes the Dynamic acquisition. Implementation of any one or more of the various proposed responses to the disaster could materially adversely affect operations in the Gulf of Mexico by raising operating costs, increasinginsurance premiums, delaying drilling operations and increasing regulatory costs, and, further, could lead to a wide variety of other unforeseeable consequences that could make operations in the Gulf of Mexico more difficult, time consuming andcostly. If the Company completes the Dynamic acquisition, new regulatory requirements could significantly delay theCompany<U+0092>s ability to obtain permits to drill new wells in offshore waters. Following theDeepwater Horizon incident, the BOEMRE issued a series of NTLs and other regulatory requirements imposing new standards and permitting procedures for new wells to be drilled in federal waters of the Outer Continental Shelf. These requirementsinclude the following:  <U+0095>  The Environmental NTL, which imposes new and more stringent requirements for documenting the environmental impacts potentially associated with thedrilling of a new offshore well and significantly increases oil spill response requirements.  <U+0095>  The Compliance and Review NTL, which imposes requirements for operators to secure independent reviews of well design, construction and flowintervention processes, and also requires certifications of compliance from senior corporate officers.  <U+0095>  The Drilling Safety Rule, which prescribes tighter cementing and casing practices, imposes standards for the use of drilling fluids to maintainwellbore integrity, and stiffens oversight requirements relating to blowout preventers and their components, including shear and pipe rams.  49  <U+0095>  The Workplace Safety Rule, which requires operators to have a comprehensive safety and environmental management system (<U+0093>SEMS<U+0094>) in orderto reduce human and organizational errors as root causes of work-related accidents and offshore spills. On September 14, 2011, BOEMRE proposed rules that would amend the Workplace Safety Rule by requiring the imposition of certain added safety procedures to a company<U+0092>s SEMS not covered by theoriginal rule and revising existing obligations that a company<U+0092>s SEMS be audited by requiring the use of an independent third party auditor who has been pre-approved by the agency to perform the auditing task. As a result of the issuance of these new regulatory requirements, the BSEE has been taking much longer than in the pastto review and approve permits for drilling operations. If the Company completes the Dynamic acquisition, it may encounter increased costs associated with regulatory compliance and delays in obtaining permits for other operations such asrecompletions, workovers and abandonment activities. The Company is unsure what long-term effect, if any, additional regulatory requirements and permitting procedures will have on offshore operations. Consequently, if the Company completes theDynamic acquisition, the Company may become subject to a variety of unforeseen adverse consequences arising directly or indirectly from the Deepwater Horizon incident. If the Company completes the Dynamic acquisition, new regulatory requirements could significantly impact the Company<U+0092>s estimates of future asset retirement obligations from period to period. If the Company completes the Dynamic acquisition, it will be responsible for plugging and abandoningwellbores and decommissioning associated platforms, pipelines and facilities on Dynamic<U+0092>s oil and natural gas properties. In addition to the NTLs discussed previously, the BOEMRE issued an NTL that became effective in October 2010, whichestablishes more stringent requirements for the timely decommissioning of wells, platforms and pipelines that are no longer producing or serving exploration or support functions related to an operator<U+0092>s lease in the Gulf of Mexico. This NTLrequires that any well that has not been used during the past five years for exploration or production on an active lease and is no longer capable of producing in paying quantities must be permanently plugged or temporarily abandoned within threeyears. Plugging or abandonment of wells may be delayed by two years if all of the well<U+0092>s hydrocarbon and sulphur zones are appropriately isolated. Similarly, platforms or other facilities that are no longer useful for operations must be removedwithin one year of the cessation of operations. If the Company completes the Dynamic acquisition, these new regulations affecting plugging, abandonment and removal activities may serve to increase, perhaps materially, the future plugging,abandonment and removal costs associated with Dynamic<U+0092>s properties, which may translate into a need to increase the Company<U+0092>s estimate of future asset retirement obligations required to meet such increased costs. Moreover, implementationof this NTL could likely result in increased demand for salvage contractors and equipment, resulting in increased estimates of plugging, abandonment and removal costs and increases in related asset retirement obligations. If the Company completes the Dynamic Acquisition, its estimates of future asset retirement obligations may increase significantlyand become more variable from period to period because Dynamic<U+0092>s operations are exclusively in the Gulf of Mexico. The Company is required to record a liability for the present value of asset retirement obligations to plug and abandon inactive, non-producing wells, to remove inactive or damaged platforms, facilitiesand equipment, and to restore the land or seabed at the end of oil and natural gas production operations. These costs are typically considerably more expensive for offshore operations as compared to most land-based operations, due to increasedregulatory scrutiny and the logistical issues associated with working in waters of various depths. Estimating future restoration and removal costs in the Gulf of Mexico is especially difficult because most of the removal obligations may be manyyears in the future, regulatory requirements are subject to change or more restrictive interpretation, and asset removal technologies are constantly evolving, which may result in additional or increased costs. As a result, if the Company completesthe Dynamic acquisition, it may make significant  50 increases or decreases to estimated asset retirement obligations in future periods. For example, because Dynamic operates in the Gulf of Mexico, platforms, facilities and equipment are subject todamage or destruction as a result of hurricanes. The estimated cost to plug and abandon a well or dismantle a platform can change dramatically if the host platform from which the work was anticipated to be performed is damaged or toppled, ratherthan structurally intact. Accordingly, if the Company completes the Dynamic acquisition, its estimates of future asset retirement obligations could differ dramatically from what it may ultimately incur as a result of damage from a hurricane. If the Company completes the Dynamic acquisition, insurance may not protect the Company against business and operatingrisks associated with Dynamic<U+0092>s properties. If the Company completes the Dynamic acquisition, itintends to maintain insurance for some, but not all, of the potential risks and liabilities associated with Dynamic<U+0092>s business. For some risks, the Company may not obtain insurance if it believes the cost of available insurance is excessiverelative to the risks presented. Due to market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and, in some instances, certain insurance policies are economically unavailable or available only forreduced amounts of coverage. Although the Company will maintain insurance at levels it believes are appropriate and consistent with industry practice, the Company will not be fully insured against all risks, including high-cost business interruptioninsurance and drilling and completion risks that are generally not recoverable from third parties or insurance. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. Losses and liabilities from uninsured and underinsuredevents and delay in the payment of insurance proceeds could have a material adverse effect on the Company<U+0092>s business, financial condition and results of operations. Insurance costs have generally risen in recent years due to a number of catastrophic events, including Hurricanes Ivan,Katrina, Rita, Gustav and Ike, the Deepwater Horizon incident, the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the 2011 Japanese tsunami. The offshore oil and natural gas industry suffered extensive damage from the previously mentioned hurricanesand, as a result, insurance costs related to offshore oil and gas operations have increased significantly compared to the cost of insuring onshore oil and gas production. Insurers are requiring higher retention levels and limit the amount ofinsurance proceeds that are available after a major windstorm in the event that damages are incurred. If storm activity in the future is as severe as it was in 2005 or 2008, insurance underwriters may no longer insure Gulf of Mexico assets againstweather-related damage. In addition, the Company does not have in place, and does not intend to put in place, business interruption insurance due to its high cost. If the Company completes the Dynamic acquisition and an accident or other eventresults in damage to offshore operations, including severe weather, terrorist acts, war, civil disturbances, pollution or environmental damage, occurs and is not fully covered by insurance or a recoverable indemnity from a vendor, it could adverselyaffect the Company<U+0092>s business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, the Company may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates it considers reasonable or be able to obtain insurance against certainrisks. Item 1B.\""
