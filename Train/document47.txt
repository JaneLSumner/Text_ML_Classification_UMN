[1] "[1] \"Item 1A - Risk Factors .  Fiscal Year 2013 Results of Operations Financial Overview - Consolidated Fiscal year 2013 consolidated net sales were $1.20 billion compared to fiscal year 2012 net sales of $1.14 billion, a 5% increase, resulting from a 14% increase in the EMS segment which more than offset a 5% decrease in the Furniture segment.  Fiscal year 2013 net income was $19.9 million, or $0.52 per Class B diluted share, inclusive of $0.3 million, or $0.01 per Class B diluted share, of after-tax restructuring costs.  The Company recorded net income for fiscal year 2012 of $11.6 million, or $0.31 per Class B diluted share, inclusive of $2.1 million, or $0.06 per Class B diluted share, of after-tax restructuring costs primarily related to the European consolidation plan. 25  Consolidated gross profit as a percent of net sales improved to 18.6% for fiscal year 2013 from 18.4% in fiscal year 2012 due to margin improvement in the EMS segment, which was partially offset by a decline in Furniture segment margin coupled with a shift in sales mix (as depicted in the table below) toward the EMS segment which operates at a lower gross profit percentage than the Furniture segment.  Gross profit is discussed in more detail in the segment discussions below. Segment Net Sales as a % of Consolidated Net Sales Year Ended  June 30  2013  2012 EMS segment 58%  54% Furniture segment 42%  46% Fiscal year 2013 consolidated selling and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales increased 0.2 of a percentage point compared to fiscal year 2012, and increased 6.5% in absolute dollars primarily due to increased incentive compensation costs.  In addition, we recorded $2.0 million more expense within selling and administrative expenses in fiscal year 2013 than fiscal year 2012 related to the normal revaluation to fair value of the Company's Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan (\\\"SERP\\\") liability.  The revaluation of the SERP liability recorded in selling and administrative expenses is offset by the revaluation of the SERP investment recorded in Other Income (Expense), and thus there was no effect on net income. Other income (expense) consisted of the following: Other Income (Expense) Year Ended  June 30 (Amounts in Thousands) 2013  2012 Interest Income $ 404   $ 430  Interest Expense (35 )  (35 ) Foreign Currency/Derivative Gain (Loss) (112 )  568  Gain (Loss) on Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan Investment 2,000   (3 ) Impairment on Privately-Held Investment (1,019 )  (715 ) Loss on Stock Warrants (885 )  (526 ) Other (691 )  (406 ) Other Expense, net $ (338 )  $ (687 ) The impairment on the privately-held investment and the loss on stock warrants listed in the table above both relate to the Company's investment in one privately-held company.  See the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information. Our income before income taxes and effective tax rate was comprised of the following U.S. and foreign components:  Year Ended June 30 , 2013  Year Ended June 30 , 2012 (Amounts in Thousands) Income Before Taxes  Effective Tax Rate  Income Before Taxes  Effective Tax Rate United States $ 2,525   (24.5 )%  $ 7,831   41.5 % Foreign $ 20,138   16.9 %  $ 9,871   28.9 % Total $ 22,663   12.3 %  $ 17,702   34.3 % During fiscal year 2013, we had a disproportionate mix of sales and pre-tax income between our foreign and domestic operations.  Our foreign operations recorded $20.1 million of pre-tax income on $353.9 million of sales and our domestic operations recorded $2.5 million of pre-tax income on $849.2 million of sales.  The lower domestic pre-tax income in fiscal year 2013 was primarily caused by 1) the Furniture segment (all domestic operations) which generated a small pre-tax loss for the year resulting from the loss of fixed cost leverage due to its low sales volume for the year and 2) the unallocated corporate loss during the year partially resulting from an impairment loss on a privately-held investment.  Our consolidated effective tax rate in fiscal year 2013 was 12.3% compared to 34.3% in fiscal year 2012.  The statutory tax rates in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate are lower than the U.S.  As a result of the lower foreign tax rates, the significantly higher proportion of earnings coming from foreign locations in fiscal year 2013 had a favorable impact on the 26  consolidated effective tax rate in fiscal year 2013.  In addition, the fiscal year 2013 consolidated effective tax rate was favorably impacted by U.S. tax credits.  These tax credits, coupled with relatively low pre-tax income in the U.S., caused the negative U.S. tax rate shown above.  The foreign effective tax rate in fiscal year 2012 was unfavorably impacted by currency fluctuations that are not taxed in the foreign jurisdictions.  See Note 8 - Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Electronic Manufacturing Services Segment EMS segment results follow:  At or For the Year     Ended June 30   (Amounts in Millions) 2013  2012  % Change Net Sales $ 703.1   $ 616.8   14 % Operating Income $ 27.5   $ 8.9   209 % Operating Income % 3.9 %  1.4 %   Net Income $ 21.1   $ 6.6   222 % Restructuring Expense, net of tax $ 0.1   $ 1.7     Open Orders $ 174.5   $ 170.6   2 % Fiscal year 2013 EMS segment net sales to customers in the automotive, medical, industrial, and public safety industries all increased compared to fiscal year 2012.  Sales to customers in the automotive industry were favorably impacted by the strength in the U.S. market, the uptick in the China market, and additional program awards from existing customers in the European market.  Sales to customers in the medical industry improved on increased demand from existing customers and new customer program awards.  Sales to customers in the industrial market increased primarily on additional program awards from an existing customer and the increased demand from customers that provide product and solutions to climate control applications compared to the prior fiscal year.  Sales to customers in the public safety industry benefited from the ramp up of select product lines.  Open orders as of June 30, 2013 were up 2% compared to June 30, 2012. Fiscal year 2013 EMS segment gross profit as a percent of net sales improved 2.0 percentage points when compared to fiscal year 2012.  The improvement in gross profit as a percent of net sales was primarily the result of leverage gained on higher revenue as well as benefits gained from global purchasing efforts and operating efficiencies related to continuous improvement initiatives.  The EMS segment fiscal year 2013 gross profit was also favorably impacted by the benefits realized from restructuring activities in which two facilities were closed during the second quarter of fiscal year 2012.  EMS segment fiscal year 2013 gross profit was unfavorably impacted by a $1.4 million inventory reserve recorded relating to a customer that notified us they were going out of business. EMS segment selling and administrative expenses in absolute dollars increased 15% in fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012, and were flat as a percent of net sales due to the higher sales volumes.  The selling and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs related to the significant improvement in the EMS segment earnings. The previously announced exit of the Company's small assembly facility located in Fremont, California was completed during fiscal year 2012 along with the associated move of a majority of that business to the Jasper, Indiana facility.  In addition, the previously announced consolidation of the Company's European EMS facilities was likewise completed during fiscal year 2012.  See Note 17 - Restructuring Expense of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on restructuring charges. EMS segment Other Income (Expense) for fiscal year 2013 totaled expense of $0.9 million, compared to expense of $0.3 million in fiscal year 2012.  The variance in Other Income (Expense) was primarily related to net foreign currency exchange movement. 27  Included in this segment were a significant amount of sales to Johnson Controls, Inc. which accounted for the following portions of consolidated net sales and EMS segment net sales:  Year Ended June 30  2013  2012 Johnson Controls, Inc. sales as a percent of consolidated net sales 10%  9% Johnson Controls, Inc. sales as a percent of EMS segment net sales 17%  17%  Furniture Segment Furniture segment results follow:  At or For the Year    Ended June 30   (Amounts in Millions) 2013  2012  % Change Net Sales $ 500.0   $ 525.3   (5 )% Operating Income (Loss) $ (0.4 )  $ 11.9   (103 )% Operating Income (Loss) % (0.1 )%  2.3 %   Net Income $ 0.1   $ 7.0   (99 )% Open Orders $ 95.7   $ 72.0   33 % The fiscal year 2013 net sales decrease in the Furniture segment compared to fiscal year 2012 resulted primarily from decreased net sales of hospitality furniture and to a lesser extent from decreased net sales of office furniture.  The lower hospitality furniture net sales were due to two unusually large custom projects that were completed during fiscal year 2012.  The decrease in office furniture net sales was due to decreased sales volumes which more than offset the positive impact of price increases net of incremental discounting.  The largest driver of the decreased office furniture sales volumes was lower sales to the federal government.  Open orders of furniture products at June 30, 2013 increased 33% from the orders open as of June 30, 2012 on higher orders of both office furniture and hospitality furniture. Fiscal year 2013 Furniture segment gross profit as a percent of net sales declined 0.4 of a percentage point when compared to fiscal year 2012.  Items unfavorably impacting the year-over-year gross margin comparison were the loss of leverage due to lower current year sales volumes, an unfavorable sales mix, a prior year favorable impact resulting from a decrease in the LIFO inventory reserve, and a prior year recovery of previously paid import duties related to a retroactive change in a tariff rate.  Fiscal year 2013 gross profit as a percent of net sales was favorably impacted by sales price increases net of incremental discounting and by lower commodity costs. Compared to fiscal year 2012, fiscal year 2013 selling and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales increased 1.9 percentage points largely due to the lower sales volumes and also due to a 2.1% absolute dollar increase in selling and administrative expenses driven by higher incentive compensation costs which were partially offset by decreased sales and marketing costs and decreased commission expense.  Liquidity and Capital Resources Working capital at June 30, 2014 was $246.2 million compared to working capital of $214.4 million at June 30, 2013 .  The current ratio was 2.0 at both June 30, 2014 and June 30, 2013 . Our measure of accounts receivable performance, also referred to as Days Sales Outstanding (\\\"DSO\\\"), for fiscal year 2014 of 46.3 days increased compared to the 44.0 days for fiscal year 2013 .  The DSO increase was primarily driven by the mix of sales among customers in the EMS segment.  We define DSO as the average of monthly accounts and notes receivable divided by an average day's net sales.  Our Production Days Supply on Hand (\\\"PDSOH\\\") of inventory measure for fiscal year 2014 declined to 53.5 days from 55.6 days for fiscal year 2013 .  The improved PDSOH compared to the prior fiscal year resulted primarily from ongoing successful initiatives to reduce or maintain EMS segment inventory levels as the business grows.  We define PDSOH as the average of the monthly gross inventory divided by an average day's cost of sales. 28  Kimball's short-term liquidity available, represented as cash and cash equivalents plus the unused amounts of our credit facilities, totaled $221.5 million at June 30, 2014 compared to $185.2 million at June 30, 2013 .  We had no short-term borrowings outstanding as of June 30, 2014 or June 30, 2013 . Our cash and cash equivalents position improved to $136.6 million at June 30, 2014 from $103.6 million at June 30, 2013 , with $26.3 million held by our foreign operations as of June 30, 2014 .  Except for the nontaxable repayment of intercompany loans, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds to our U.S. operations.  However, if these funds were repatriated rather than used to repay intercompany loans, the amount remitted would be subject to U.S. income taxes and applicable non-U.S. income and withholding taxes. Operating activities generated $69.9 million of cash flow in fiscal year 2014 compared to the $63.9 million of cash generated by operating activities in fiscal year 2013 largely due to increased net income.  Changes in working capital balances provided $5.4 million of cash in fiscal year 2014 compared to providing cash of $6.4 million in fiscal year 2013.  Cash generated from operating activities in fiscal year 2012 totaled $59.0 million and changes in working capital balances provided $8.7 million of cash. The $5.4 million of cash provided by changes in working capital balances in fiscal year 2014 was primarily driven by a $19.5 million increase in accrued expenses largely due to higher accrued profit-based incentive compensation and a $15.7 million increase in accounts payable related to increased inventory purchases and an increase in customer deposits received on custom orders which we classify in accounts payable.  These sources of cash were partially offset by a $14.9 million inventory increase during fiscal year 2014 to support increased sales volumes and a $14.6 million increase in accounts receivable driven by the increased sales levels and a shift in the payment practices of several EMS segment customers. The $6.4 million of cash provided by changes in working capital balances in fiscal year 2013 was driven by a $17.7 million accounts payable increase primarily resulting from increased EMS segment production volumes and a $7.9 million increase in accrued expenses due to higher accrued profit-based incentive compensation.  These sources of cash were offset partially by a $19.5 million increase in accounts receivable primarily resulting from higher fiscal year 2013 EMS segment sales volumes and a shift in the mix of EMS segment sales at the end of fiscal year 2013 toward customers with longer payment terms. The $8.7 million of cash provided by changes in working capital balances in fiscal year 2012 was driven by a $20.5 million decline in our inventory balance due to successful inventory reduction initiatives in both segments, decreased accounts receivable balances of $6.7 million resulting from lower EMS segment sales levels and a shift in the payment practices of three large EMS segment customers during fiscal year 2012, and a $6.4 million decline in prepaid expenses and other current assets.  These sources of cash were partially offset by a $17.7 million decline in accrued expenses primarily driven by a decline in accrued compensation and a decline in accrued restructuring from the completion of the European consolidation plan and a $7.1 million accounts payable decline in conjunction with the reduced inventory levels. For fiscal years ended June 30, 2014, June 30, 2013, and June 30, 2012 net cash used for investing activities was $27.5 million , $28.0 million , and $25.7 million , respectively.  During fiscal years 2014 , 2013, and 2012 we reinvested $33.7 million , $28.8 million , and $28.3 million , respectively into capital investments for the future with the largest investments being made for manufacturing equipment and facility improvements within both segments.  During fiscal year 2015, we expect to increase our investment in capital expenditures, particularly for projects that will enhance our capabilities and diversification while providing an opportunity for growth and improved profitability including potential acquisitions if the opportunity arises. For fiscal years ended June 30, 2014, June 30, 2013, and June 30, 2012 net cash used for financing activities was $9.4 million , $7.7 million , and $7.7 million , respectively.  We paid dividends of $7.5 million , $7.4 million , and $7.4 million , in fiscal years 2014 , 2013, and 2012, respectively.  Consistent with our historical dividend policy, the Company's Board of Directors will evaluate the appropriate dividend payment on a quarterly basis. During fiscal year 2015, we anticipate cash outflow of approximately $28 million for deferred incentive compensation related to our fiscal year 2014 performance. We maintain a $75 million credit facility (the \\\"primary facility\\\") with a maturity date of December 2017 that allows for both issuances of letters of credit and cash borrowings.  The primary facility provides an option to increase the amount available for borrowing to $115 million at our request, subject to the consent of the participating banks.  At both June 30, 2014 and June 30, 2013 , we had no short-term borrowings outstanding under the primary facility.  At June 30, 2014 , we had $1.1 million in letters of credit which reduced our borrowing capacity on the primary facility. The $75 million credit facility requires us to comply with certain debt covenants, the most significant of which are the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA (debt to EBITDA) and minimum net worth (excluding accumulated other comprehensive income).  We were in compliance with the debt covenants of the credit facility during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 . 29  The table below compares the actual net worth and debt to EBITDA ratio with the limits specified in the credit agreement. Covenant  At or For the Period Ended June 30, 2014  Limit As Specified in Credit Agreement  Excess Minimum Net Worth   $439,094,000    $362,000,000    $77,094,000  Debt to EBITDA Ratio  0.02   3.00   2.98  The debt to EBITDA Ratio is calculated on a rolling four-quarter basis as defined in the credit agreement. We believe our principal sources of liquidity from available funds on hand, cash generated from operations, and the availability of borrowing under our credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other operating needs for at least the next 12 months. In addition to the $75 million primary facility, Kimball can opt to utilize foreign credit facilities which are available to satisfy short-term cash needs at a specific foreign location rather than funding from intercompany sources.  At June 30, 2014 we had a Thailand overdraft credit facility which allows for borrowings up to 90.0 million Thai Baht (approximately $2.8 million at June 30, 2014 exchange rates).  We also have a credit facility for our EMS segment operation in Poland, which allows for multi-currency borrowings up to 6.0 million Euro equivalent (approximately $8.2 million U.S. dollars at June 30, 2014 exchange rates).  These foreign credit facilities can be canceled at any time by either the bank or by us.  We had no borrowings outstanding under these foreign credit facilities as of June 30, 2014 or June 30, 2013 . Total availability to borrow in USD equivalent under all of our credit facilities totaled $84.9 million at June 30, 2014 . Another source of funds in addition to our credit facilities has been our ability to generate cash from operations to meet our liquidity obligations which could be adversely affected in the future by factors such as general economic and market conditions, lack of availability of raw material components in the supply chain, a decline in demand for our products and services, loss of key contract customers/programs, our ability to generate profits, and other unforeseen circumstances.  In particular, should demand for our products decrease significantly over the next 12 months, the available cash provided by operations could be adversely impacted. The preceding statements include forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Certain factors could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements.  Fair Value During fiscal year 2014 , no level 1 or level 2 financial instruments were affected by a lack of market liquidity.  For level 1 financial assets, readily available market pricing was used to value the financial instruments.  Our foreign currency derivatives, which were classified as level 2 assets/liabilities, were independently valued using observable market inputs such as forward interest rate yield curves, current spot rates, and time value calculations. To verify the reasonableness of the independently determined fair values, these derivative fair values were compared to fair values calculated by the counterparty banks.  Our own credit risk and counterparty credit risk had an immaterial impact on the valuation of the foreign currency derivatives. Kimball currently holds non-marketable equity securities and stock warrants of a privately-held company.  Due to certain events and changes in circumstances that had adverse effects on the fair value of the investment in the privately-held company, we revalued the investment which, during fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, resulted in a $0.1 million , $1.0 million , and $0.7 million impairment on the equity securities, and a less than $0.1 million, $0.9 million , and $0.5 million derivative loss on the stock warrants.  The investment in non-marketable equity securities is accounted for as a cost-method investment which carries the securities at cost.  In the event of impairment, the valuation uses a probability-weighted Black-Scholes option pricing model.  The stock warrants are classified as derivative instruments and are valued on a recurring basis using a market-based approach which utilizes a probability-weighted Black-Scholes option pricing model.  The fair value measurements for stock warrants and the impairment of non-marketable equity securities were calculated using unobservable inputs and were classified as level 3 financial assets. See Note 10 - Fair Value of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.  30  Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the Company's contractual obligations as of June 30, 2014 .  Payments Due During Fiscal Years Ending June 30 (Amounts in Millions) Total  2015  2016-2017  2018-2019  Thereafter Recorded Contractual Obligations: (a)                  Long-Term Debt Obligations  (b) $ 0.3   $     $     $ 0.1    $ 0.2  Other Long-Term Liabilities Reflected on the Balance Sheet (c) (d) (e) 33.7   12.2    4.0    4.7    12.8  Unrecorded Contractual Obligations:                 Operating Leases (e) 25.7   3.3    6.1    5.0    11.3  Purchase Obligations (f) 213.6   200.2    7.7    5.7      Other 0.1               0.1  Total $ 273.4   $ 215.7    $ 17.8    $ 15.5    $ 24.4  (a) As of June 30, 2014 , the Company had less than $0.1 million of Capital Lease Obligations. (b) Refer to Note 5 - Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding Long-Term Debt Obligations.  Accrued interest is also included on the Long-Term Debt Obligations line.  The fiscal year 2015 amount includes less than $0.1 million of long-term debt obligations due in fiscal year 2015 which were recorded as a current liability.  The estimated interest not yet accrued related to debt is included in the Other line item within the Unrecorded Contractual Obligations. (c) The timing of payments of certain items included on the \\\"Other Long-Term Liabilities Reflected on the Balance Sheet\\\" line above is estimated based on the following assumptions:  The timing of SERP payments is estimated based on an assumed retirement age of 62 with payout based on the prior distribution elections of participants.  The fiscal year 2015 amount includes $8.8 million for SERP payments recorded as current liabilities.  The timing of severance plan payments is estimated based on the average remaining service life of employees.  The fiscal year 2015 amount includes $1.0 million for severance payments recorded as a current liability.  The timing of warranty payments is estimated based on historical data.  The fiscal year 2015 amount includes $1.5 million for short-term warranty payments recorded as a current liability. (d) Excludes $4.5 million of long-term unrecognized tax benefits and associated accrued interest and penalties along with deferred tax liabilities and miscellaneous other long-term tax liabilities which are not tied to a contractual obligation and for which the Company cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of future payments. (e) Refer to Note 4 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding Operating Leases and certain Other Long-Term Liabilities. (f) Purchase Obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms.  The amounts listed above for purchase obligations include contractual commitments for items such as raw materials, supplies, capital expenditures, services, and software acquisitions/license commitments.  Cancellable purchase obligations that we intend to fulfill are also included in the purchase obligations amount listed above through fiscal year 2019.  In certain instances, such as when lead times dictate, we enter into contractual agreements for material in excess of the levels required to fulfill customer orders.  In turn, agreements with the customers cover a portion of that exposure for the material which was purchased prior to having a firm order.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements other than standby letters of credit and operating leases entered into in the normal course of business.  These arrangements do not have a material current effect and are not reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.  See Note 4 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on standby letters of credit.  We do not have material exposures to trading activities of non-exchange traded contracts. 31  Critical Accounting Policies Kimball's consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  These principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and related notes.  Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions.  Management uses its best judgment in the assumptions used to value these estimates, which are based on current facts and circumstances, prior experience, and other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable.  Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements and are the policies that are most critical in the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations.  Management has discussed these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors and with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. Revenue recognition - We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.  Delivery is not considered to have occurred until the title and the risk of loss passes to the customer according to the terms of the contract.  Title and risk of loss are transferred upon shipment to or receipt at our customers locations, or in limited circumstances, as determined by other specific sales terms of the transaction.  Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recorded as sales while the related shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold.  We recognize sales net of applicable sales tax.  Sales returns and allowances - Based on estimated product returns and price concessions, a reserve for returns and allowances is recorded at the time of the sale, resulting in a reduction of revenue.  These estimates may change over time causing the provisions to be adjusted accordingly.  At June 30, 2014 and June 30, 2013 , the reserve for returns and allowances was $1.3 million and $1.7 million , respectively.  The returns and allowances reserve approximated 1% to 2% of gross trade receivables during fiscal years 2014 and 2013.   Allowance for doubtful accounts - Our estimate for the allowance for credit losses on trade accounts receivable and notes receivable includes analysis of such items as aging, credit worthiness, payment history, and historical bad debt experience.  Management uses these specific analyses in conjunction with an evaluation of the general economic and market conditions to determine the final allowance for credit losses on the trade accounts receivable and notes receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts at both June 30, 2014 and June 30, 2013 was $1.8 million .  This reserve approximated 1% of gross trade accounts receivable during fiscal years 2014 and 2013. Excess and obsolete inventory - Inventories were valued using the lower of last-in, first-out (\\\"LIFO\\\") cost or market value for approximately 16% of consolidated inventories at both June 30, 2014 and June 30, 2013 , including approximately 89% and 87% of the Furniture segment inventories at June 30, 2014 and June 30, 2013 , respectively.  The remaining inventories were valued at lower of first-in, first-out (\\\"FIFO\\\") cost or market value.  Inventories recorded on our balance sheet are adjusted for excess and obsolete inventory.  In general, we purchase materials and finished goods for our contract-based business from customer orders and projections, primarily in the case of long lead time items, and we have a general philosophy to only purchase materials to the extent covered by a written commitment from our customers. However, there are times when inventory is purchased beyond customer commitments due to minimum lot sizes and inventory lead time requirements, or where component allocation or other procurement issues may exist.  We may also purchase additional inventory to support transfers of production between manufacturing facilities.  Evaluation of excess inventory includes such factors as anticipated usage, inventory turnover, inventory levels, and product demand levels.  Factors considered when evaluating inventory obsolescence include the age of on-hand inventory and reduction in value due to damage, use as showroom samples, design changes, or cessation of product lines.  When we estimate that the current market value is below cost or determine that future demand is lower than current inventory levels, based on our evaluation of the above factors or other relevant current and projected factors associated with current economic conditions, a reduction in inventory cost to estimated net realizable value will be recorded as expense in Cost of Sales.  We recorded expense of $1.4 million for excess and obsolete inventory in fiscal year 2013 related to inventory specific to one customer who went out of business. Self-insurance reserves - We are self-insured up to certain limits for auto and general liability, workers' compensation, and certain employee health benefits such as medical, short-term disability, and dental with the related liabilities included in the accompanying financial statements.  Our policy is to estimate reserves based upon a number of factors including known claims, estimated incurred but not reported claims, and other analyses, which are based on historical information along with certain assumptions about future events.  Changes in assumptions for such matters as increased medical costs and changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change and reserve levels to be adjusted accordingly.  At June 30, 2014 and June 30, 2013 , our accrued liabilities for self-insurance exposure were $4.2 million and $3.5 million, respectively. Taxes - Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax 32  bases.  These assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse.  We evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our deferred tax assets.  If recovery is not likely, we provide a valuation allowance based on our best estimate of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions and the amount of deferred taxes ultimately realizable.  Future events could change management's assessment. We operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions.  These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve.
